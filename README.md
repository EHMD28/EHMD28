# Greetings fellow non-robotic homosapiens.  

I am a software developer with an interest in robotics and low-level programming. A full list of my projects can be found [here](https://ehmd28.github.io/projects). I mainly use Rust and Kotlin, but I also have experience in C, Java, and Python.

## Finished Projects

Here is a showcase of some of my best projects.

### [M-Calculator](https://github.com/EHMD28/m-calc_ver.4) 

This is the first moderately-complex project I worked on. It is a fully-featured
scientific calculator that I wrote entirely in C. It utilizes a
recursive-descent parser to evaluate mathematical expressions. The program can
be run either as as a REPL or through command line arguments. The project resulted in me
creating two header libraries: [m-logging](https://github.com/EHMD28/m-logging) and
[arachne-strlib](https://github.com/EHMD28/arachne-strlib).

### [Chef Suggest Desktop](https://github.com/EHMD28/ChefSuggest/desktop)

I made this project for a family member because they dind't want to deal with the hassle of figuring out what to have for dinner each week. The program is a meal suggestor, where the generated meals can be filtered and saved. I plan to make a mobile app to go along with this one. I also want to connect the meals to a database. 

## Current Projects

### [Minerva Study Tool](https://EHMD28.github.io/programs/minerva)

This project is a flashcard study tool I am making to help me study French. I originally used Quizlet, but I didn't feel like paying for a pro membership, so I decided to make my own program instead. Right now, there are only a few features I
still a few features I need to implement, but the essentials are working. 

### [Android Development](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course)

Right now, I am working my way through the "Android Basics with Compose" course offered by the official Android developers. I plan to make a mobile app version of the [Chef Suggest](https://github.com/EHMD28/ChefSuggest) program I already made.
