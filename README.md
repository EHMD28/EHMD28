# Greetings fellow non-robotic homosapiens.  

I am a software developer with an interest in robotics and low-level programming. A full list of my projects can be found [here](https://ehmd28.github.io/). I mainly use Rust and Kotlin, but I also have experience in C, Java, and Python.

## Finished Projects

Here is a showcase of some of my best projects.

### [M-Calculator](https://github.com/EHMD28/m-calc_ver.4) 

This is the first moderately-complex project I worked on. It is a fully-featured
scientific calculator that I wrote entirely in C. It utilizes a
recursive-descent parser to evaluate mathematical expressions. The program can
be run either as as a REPL or through command line arguments. The project resulted in me
creating two header libraries: [m-logging](https://github.com/EHMD28/m-logging) and
[arachne-strlib](https://github.com/EHMD28/arachne-strlib).

## Current Projects

### [Kingdom Kards Game Server](https://github.com/EHMD28/kingdom-kards)

THis project is a TCP server written in Rust created for a card game I invented called Kingdom Kards.
